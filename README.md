### Project title
Tinder for Food

### What and why?
People often get bored of eating from the same place and not exploring new places to eat. They may be too lazy to research new places. This app would solve that issues by bringing the research to them in a simply and efficient format. 

### For whom?
Anyone who likes to eat food. This would also be beneficial for restaurants because it will provide them more exposure.

### How?
Like dating apps, the user will be able to quickly view the descriptions such as type of food, price, distance, sanitary rating, and etc. The options provided to the user will be based on preferences they will be able set in their account. The places they swipe right on will be saved to their matches. 

### Scope
This project will not be too complicated but will require strong front end work and be data driven.
